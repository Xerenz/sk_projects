ML examples using sklearn library

The first project is an example from the sklearn diabetes dataset using LinearRegression model.
Originally written in jupyter notebook there is a .py file as a seperate viewer

Secndly I implemented Linear Refression from scratch. This is in reference to the Andrew Ng Coursera course. 
The data used is this example is in the data2.txt file.
